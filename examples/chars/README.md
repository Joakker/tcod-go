# Chars Demo

There are 3 modes to this demo:

## Normal Mode

Invoke the program with no flags. First enter an Ascii character to standard
input, and the program will render a window containing that character's
corresponding sprite.

## All Characters Mode

Invoke the program with the `-all` flag. It will automatically render a window
containing all 256 characters that appear in the font file.
